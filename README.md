# covid-19-hackathon

This repo originated as a part of a hackathon sponsored by Wei Shung, and he created the stub data access code. Thanks to him for taking the initiative to get some data geeks going.

# by_state_covid_analysis

This analysis code is described in this presentation:
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kIeD-NMUM554xr3uRPVTRH7SidZ2B7bgXLWpCiyDMXI/edit?usp=sharing

It is designed front-to-back to run in a Colab Jupyter notebook and updates with a very few changes (mostly to the dates of analysis).

We've done our best to document the data sets, methodology, assumptions and known caveats (most specifically the variance created by the lack of testing data).
